This is [an example](http://example.com/) inline link.

How to set up a blog with Octopress:

Step (1): 

Sign up for a GitHub Account. Go to [http://github.com](http://github.com) and click the Sign up for GitHub button.

Step (2):

Prepare yourself to access GitHub from the command line. Follow the Installing Git instructions in Scott Chacon's Pro Git book at:
[http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git].

Proceed to set up your username and password with the commands:
git config --global user.name "Your name here"
git config --global git config --global user.email your_name@example.com

Enable SSH connections between your computer and GitHub (so you do not have to type in a username and password all of the time). Go to: [https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys).

If you are confused, try Lauren Orsini's GitHub beginners article:
[http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1](http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1) as well as the Getting Started - First time Git setup [http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup)

Step (3):

Set up a repository by logging into your GitHub account. Following the instructions up to creating a README will work:
[https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo).

Step (4):

Follow the tutorial at Tom Ordonez's site: [http://www.tomordonez.com/blog/2012/06/04/creating-a-github-blog-using-octopress/](http://www.tomordonez.com/blog/2012/06/04/creating-a-github-blog-using-octopress/).
